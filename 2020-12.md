## 2020-12-29: Joseph and Mary Take Jesus to the Temple

>*^22 The time came for making Mary “clean” as required by the Law of Moses. So Joseph and Mary took Jesus to Jerusalem. There they presented him to the Lord. ^23 In the Law of the Lord it says, “The first boy born in every family must be set apart for the Lord.” (Exodus 13:2,12) ^24 They also offered a sacrifice. They did it in keeping with the Law, which says, “a pair of doves or two young pigeons.” (Leviticus 12:8)

^25 In Jerusalem there was a man named Simeon. He was a good and godly man. He was waiting for God’s promise to Israel to come true. The Holy Spirit was with him. ^26 The Spirit had told Simeon that he would not die before he had seen the Lord’s Messiah. ^27 The Spirit led him into the temple courtyard. Then Jesus’ parents brought the child in. They came to do for him what the Law required. ^28 Simeon took Jesus in his arms and praised God. He said,

^29 "Lord, you are the King over all. Now let me, your servant, go in peace. That is what you promised.
^30 My eyes have seen your salvation.
^31 You have prepared it in the sight of all nations.
^32 It is a light to be given to the Gentiles. It will be the glory of your people Israel."

^33 The child’s father and mother were amazed at what was said about him. ^34 Then Simeon blessed them. He said to Mary, Jesus’ mother, “This child is going to cause many people in Israel to fall and to rise. God has sent him. But many will speak against him. ^35 The thoughts of many hearts will be known. A sword will wound your own soul too.”

^36 There was also a prophet named Anna. She was the daughter of Penuel from the tribe of Asher. Anna was very old. After getting married, she lived with her husband seven years. ^37 Then she was a widow until she was 84. She never left the temple. She worshiped night and day, praying and going without food. ^38 Anna came up to Jesus’ family at that moment. She gave thanks to God. And she spoke about the child to all who were looking forward to the time when Jerusalem would be set free.

^39 Joseph and Mary did everything the Law of the Lord required. Then they returned to Galilee. They went to their own town of Nazareth. ^40 And the child grew and became strong. He was very wise. He was blessed by God’s grace.*
