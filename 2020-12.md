## 2020-12-29 Luke 2,22-35.

>*<sup>22</sup> The time for making them pure came as it is written in the Law of Moses. So Joseph and Mary took Jesus to Jerusalem. There they presented him to the Lord.  
<sup>23</sup> In the Law of the Lord it says, "The first boy born in every family must be set apart for the Lord."  
<sup>24</sup> They also offered a sacrifice. They did it in keeping with the Law, which says, "a pair of doves or two young pigeons."  
<sup>25</sup> In Jerusalem there was a man named Simeon. He was a good and godly man. He was waiting for God's promise to Israel to happen. The Holy Spirit was with him.  
<sup>26</sup> The Spirit had told Simeon that he would not die before he had seen the Lord's Messiah.  
<sup>27</sup> The Spirit led him into the temple courtyard. Then Jesus' parents brought the child in. They came to do for him what the Law required.  
<sup>28</sup> Simeon took Jesus in his arms and praised God. He said,  
<sup>29</sup> "Lord, you are the King over all. Now let me, your servant, go in peace. That is what you promised.   
<sup>30</sup> My eyes have seen your salvation.  
<sup>31</sup> You have prepared it in the sight of all nations.  
<sup>32</sup> It is a light to be given to those who aren't Jews. It will bring glory to your people Israel."  
<sup>33</sup> The child's father and mother were amazed at what was said about him.  
<sup>34</sup> Then Simeon blessed them. He said to Mary, Jesus' mother, "This child is going to cause many people in Israel to fall and to rise. God has sent him. But many will speak against him.  
<sup>35</sup> The thoughts of many hearts will be known. A sword will wound your own soul too."

## 2020-12-28 Matthew 2,13-18: Jesus' Family Escapes to Egypt

>*<sup>13</sup> When the Wise Men had left, Joseph had a dream. In the dream an angel of the Lord appeared to him. "Get up!" the angel said. "Take the child and his mother and escape to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you to come back. Herod is going to search for the child. He wants to kill him."  
<sup>14</sup> Joseph got up. During the night, he left for Egypt with the child and his mother Mary.  
<sup>15</sup> They stayed there until King Herod died. So the words the Lord had spoken through the prophet came true. He had said, "I chose to bring my son out of Egypt."  
<sup>16</sup> Herod realized that the Wise Men had tricked him. So he became very angry. He gave orders concerning Bethlehem and the area around it. All the boys two years old and under were to be killed. This agreed with the time when the Wise Men had seen the star.  
<sup>17</sup> In this way, the words the prophet Jeremiah spoke came true. He had said,  
<sup>18</sup> "A voice is heard in Ramah. It's the sound of crying and deep sadness. Rachel is crying over her children. She refuses to be comforted, became they are gone."*

## 2020-12-27 Luke 2,22-40: Joseph and Mary Take Jesus to the Temple

>*<sup>22</sup> The time for making them pure came as it is written in the Law of Moses. So Joseph and Mary took Jesus to Jerusalem. There they presented him to the Lord.  
<sup>23</sup> In the Law of the Lord it says, "The first boy born in every family must be set apart for the Lord."  
<sup>24</sup> They also offered a sacrifice. They did it in keeping with the Law, which says, "a pair of doves or two young pigeons."  
<sup>25</sup> In Jerusalem there was a man named Simeon. He was a good and godly man. He was waiting for God's promise to Israel to happen. The Holy Spirit was with him.  
<sup>26</sup> The Spirit had told Simeon that he would not die before he had seen the Lord's Messiah.  
<sup>27</sup> The Spirit led him into the temple courtyard. Then Jesus' parents brought the child in. They came to do for him what the Law required.  
<sup>28</sup> Simeon took Jesus in his arms and praised God. He said,  
<sup>29</sup> "Lord, you are the King over all. Now let me, your servant, go in peace. That is what you promised.   
<sup>30</sup> My eyes have seen your salvation.  
<sup>31</sup> You have prepared it in the sight of all nations.  
<sup>32</sup> It is a light to be given to those who aren't Jews. It will bring glory to your people Israel."

<sup>35</sup> The thoughts of many hearts will be known. A sword will wound your own soul too."  
<sup>36</sup> There was also a prophet named Anna. She was the daughter of Penuel from the tribe of Asher. Anna was very old. After getting married, she lived with her husband seven years.  
<sup>37</sup> Then she was a widow until she was 84. She never left the temple. She worshiped night and day, praying and going without eating.  
<sup>38</sup> Anna came up to Jesus' family at that very moment. She gave thanks to God. And she spoke about the child to all who were looking forward to the time when Jerusalem would be set free.  
<sup>39</sup> Joseph and Mary did everything the Law of the Lord required. Then they returned to Galilee. They went to their own town of Nazareth.  
<sup>40</sup> And the child grew and became strong. He was very wise. He was blessed by God's grace.*

## 2020-12-26 Matthew 10,17-22. 

>*<sup>17</sup> Watch out! Men will hand you over to the local courts. They will whip you in their synagogues.  
<sup>18</sup> You will be brought to governors and kings because of me. You will be witnesses to them and to those who aren't Jews.  
<sup>19</sup> But when they arrest you, don't worry about what you will say or how you will say it. At that time you will be given the right words to say.  
<sup>20</sup> It will not he you speaking. The Spirit of your Father will be speaking through you.  
<sup>21</sup> "Brothers will hand over brothers to be killed. Fathers will hand over their children. Children will rise up against their parents and have them put to death.  
<sup>22</sup> Everyone will hate you because of me. But anyone who stands firm to the end will be saved.*

## 2020-12-25 John 1,1-18: The Word Became Human 

>*<sup>1</sup> In the beginning, the Word was already there. The Word was with God, and the Word was God.  
<sup>2</sup> He was with God in the beginning.  
<sup>3</sup> All things were made through him. Nothing that has been made was made without him.  
<sup>4</sup> Life was in him, and that life was the light for all people.  
<sup>5</sup> The light shines in the darkness. But the darkness has not understood it.  
<sup>6</sup> A man came who was sent from God. His name was John.  
<sup>7</sup> He came to give witness about that light. He gave witness so that all people could believe.  
<sup>8</sup> John himself was not the light. He came only as a witness to the light.  
<sup>9</sup> The true light that gives light to every man was coming into the world.  
<sup>10</sup> The Word was in the world that was made through him. But the world did not recognize him.  
<sup>11</sup> He came to what was his own. But his own people did not accept him.  
<sup>12</sup> Some people did accept him. They believed in his name. He gave them the right to become children of God.  
<sup>13</sup> To be a child of God has nothing to do with human parents. Children of God are not born because of human choice or because a husband wants them to be born. They are born because of what God does.  
<sup>14</sup> The Word became a human being. He made his home with us. We have seen his glory. It is the glory of the one and only Son. He came from the Father. And he was full of grace and truth.  
<sup>15</sup> John gives witness about him. He cries out and says, "This was the one I was talking about. I said, 'He who comes after me is more important than I am. He is more important because he existed before I was born.'"  
<sup>16</sup> We have all received one blessing after another. God's grace is not limited.   
<sup>17</sup> Moses gave us the law. Jesus Christ has given us grace and truth.  
<sup>18</sup> No one has ever seen God. But God, the one and only Son, is at the Father's side. He has shown us what God is like.*
