## 2021-01-03 Matthew 2,1-12: The Wise Men Visit Jesus 
 
>*<sup>1</sup> Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea. This happened while Herod was king of Judea. After Jesus' birth, Wise Men from the east came to Jerusalem.  
<sup>2</sup> They asked, "Where is the child who has been born to be king of the Jews? When we were in the east, we saw his star. Now we have come to worship him."  
<sup>3</sup> 'When King Herod heard about it, he was very upset. Everyone in Jerusalem was troubled too.  
<sup>4</sup> So Herod called together all the chief priests of the people. He also called the teachers of the law. He asked them where the Christ was going to be born.  
<sup>5</sup> "In Bethlehem in Judea," they replied. "This is what the prophet has written. He said,  
<sup>6</sup> "'But you, Bethlehem, hi the land of Judah, are certainly not the least important among the towns of Judah. A ruler will come out of you. He will be the shepherd of my people Israel.'"  
<sup>7</sup> Then Herod called for the Wise Men secretly. He found out from them exactly when the star had appeared.  
<sup>8</sup> He sent them to Bethlehem. He said, "Go! Make a careful search for the child. As soon as you find him, bring me a report. Then I can go and worship too."  
<sup>9</sup> After the Wise Men had listened to the king, they went on their way. The star they had seen when they were in the east went ahead of them. It finally stopped over the place where the child was.  
<sup>10</sup> When they saw the star, they were filled with joy.  
<sup>11</sup> The Wise Men went to the house. There they saw the child with his mother Mary. They bowed down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures. They gave him gold, incense and myrrh.  
<sup>12</sup> But God warned them in a dream not to go back to Herod. So they returned to their country on a different road.*

>*<sup>19</sup> The Jews of Jerusalem sent priests and Levites to ask John who he was. John gave witness to them.  
<sup>20</sup> He did not try to hide the truth. He spoke to them openly. He said, "I am not the Christ."  
<sup>21</sup> They asked him, "Then who are you? Are you Elijah?" He said, "I am not." "Are you the Prophet we've been expecting?" they asked. "No," he answered.   
<sup>22</sup> "They asked one last time, "Who are you? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?"  
<sup>23</sup> "John replied, using the words of Isaiah the prophet. John said, "I'm the messenger who is calling out in the desert, 'Make the way for the Lord straight.'"  
<sup>24</sup> "Some Pharisees who had been sent  
<sup>25</sup> "asked him, "If you are not the Christ, why are you baptizing people? Why are you doing that if you aren't Elijah or the Prophet we've been expecting?"  
<sup>26</sup> "I baptize people with water," John replied. "But One is standing among you whom you do not know.  
<sup>27</sup> He is the One who comes after me. I am not good enough to untie his sandals."  
<sup>28</sup> "This all happened at Bethany on the other side of the Jordan River. That was where John was baptizing.*

## 2021-01-01 Luke 2, 16-21

>*<sup>16</sup> So they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph and the baby. The baby was lying in the manger.  
<sup>17</sup> After the shepherds had seen him, they told everyone. They reported what the angel had said about this child.  
<sup>18</sup> All who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds said to them.  
<sup>19</sup> But Mary kept all these things like a secret treasure in her heart. She thought about them over and over.  
<sup>20</sup> The shepherds returned. They gave glory and praise to God. Everything they had seen and heard was just as they had been told.  
<sup>21</sup> When the child was eight days old, he was circumcised. At the same time he was named Jesus. This was the name the angel had given him before his mother became pregnant.*
