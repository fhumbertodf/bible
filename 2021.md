>*<sup>16</sup> So they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph and the baby. The baby was lying in the manger.  
<sup>17</sup> After the shepherds had seen him, they told everyone. They reported what the angel had said about this child.  
<sup>18</sup> All who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds said to them.  
<sup>19</sup> But Mary kept all these things like a secret treasure in her heart. She thought about them over and over.  
<sup>20</sup> The shepherds returned. They gave glory and praise to God. Everything they had seen and heard was just as they had been told.  
<sup>21</sup> When the child was eight days old, he was circumcised. At the same time he was named Jesus. This was the name the angel had given him before his mother became pregnant.*
